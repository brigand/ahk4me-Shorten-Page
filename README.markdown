=== What is it?

This is a front-end for an AutoHotkey URL shortening site.  It uses bit.ly's service to shorten links.  The addresses are interchangable.  For example, http://ahk4.me/abcdefg is equivilent to http://bit.ly/abcdefg  (not real links)

=== What can I use it for?

The service only works with URLs from AutoHotkey.com or AutoHotkey.net.  This is to (attempt to) protect the api key from abuse.  You can still shorten a URL on http://bitly.com and use the code with http://ahk4.me.

=== How can I help?

If you have any ideas for expansion on this, or any other services http://ahk4.me could provide, let us know!  The site admin is interested in hearing about them.  You can post them on this thread http://ahk4.me/oVRhg9 or send a message to the site admin, daonlyfreez on the AutoHotkey forum: http://ahk4.me/nWBQKb

=== What can I use this for?

You can use the live site to shorten AutoHotkey URLs, or use this as a base for your own shortening website.  My original code is licensed under the WTFPL: http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/
